# DesignProject

The code for a freshman engineering design course project.

The project was essentially a trash/recycling bin that scans products barcodes using a camera, extracts the barcode data, looks up the item in our recyclable/non-recycable data-base, and automatically disposes of the item in the correct place via a rotisary motor. 


This link came in very useful when creating the barcode scanning and database lookup program: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/21/an-opencv-barcode-and-qr-code-scanner-with-zbar/
